# Number Guessing Game 

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python.

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the number is too high, too low, or correct â€” helping the player narrow it down.

## Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Input handling and user-friendly prompts
- Feedback after each guess (too high, too low, or correct)
- Basic game loop using Python conditionals

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open the terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python number_guessing_game.py
